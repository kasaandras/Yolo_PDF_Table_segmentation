This guide explains how to use our YOLO-based model for detecting PDF elemeents in statistical outputs using the code provided in this repository.
Prerequisites

Python 3.6+
Ultralytics library (pip install ultralytics)
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
NumPy (pip install numpy)

Getting Started

Clone this repository: https://github.com/kasaandras/Yolo_PDF_Table_segmentation/

git clone https://github.com/kasaandras/Yolo_PDF_Table_segmentation/
cd [repository-name]

Install the required dependencies:
Copypip install -r requirements.txt
Or install them individually:

pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy

Download the pre-trained model file (best.pt) included in this repository or use your own YOLO model.

Using the Detection Script
The main script for running predictions is included in this repository.
You need to customaize output_dir, the location of the model, and data_dir  variables. 

It takes some time to run this code, be patient, but once the model is in the memory predicitions will done fast. 
You can also set up the confidence level.
